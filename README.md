# DND Character Sheet – Interactive Web App

**Author:** Soluchi Fidel-Ibeabuchi
**Role:** Developer | Computer Science Student @ Howard University

The **DND Character Sheet** is a web application that allows users to create, edit, and manage custom characters inspired by **Dungeons & Dragons**. Built with modern web development practices, the app demonstrates strong **CRUD functionality, dynamic routing, and form handling** within a polished user experience.

This project was completed for my **Web Development coursework** and highlights my ability to design **interactive single-page applications with React, persistent data handling, and structured UI workflows.**

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality

* **Character Creation:** Users can create a character with a name and customizable attributes.
* **Summary Page:** Displays all user-created characters, sorted by creation date (newest first).
* **Detail Pages:** Each character has a dedicated page with expanded information and a unique URL.
* **Editing:** Users can update a character’s attributes via an edit form, with changes reflected in real time.
* **Deletion:** Characters can be removed from the summary page via the edit interface.

### Extended Functionality

* **Default Values:** Characters are initialized with default properties, making the app easy to use for first-time users.
* **Direct Navigation:** Users can seamlessly navigate between the character summary, detail pages, and edit forms.

### (Planned / Optional Features)

* Category-based attribute restrictions (e.g., character class or role-based options).
* Crew statistics page showing attribute distributions across multiple characters.
* Dynamic “success” metric for visualizing team strength.
