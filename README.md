# Web Development Project 7 - *DND Character Sheet*

Submitted by: **Soluchi Fidel-Ibeabuchi**

This web app: **insert description**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:


- [x] **The web app contains a page that features a create form to add a new character**
  - Users can name the character
  - Users can set the character‚Äôs attributes by clicking on one of several values
- [x] **The web app includes a summary page of all the user‚Äôs added characterse**
  -  The web app contains a summary page dedicated to displaying all the characters the user has made so far
  -  The summary page is sorted by creation date such that the most recently created characters appear at the top
- [x] **A previously created character can be updated from the list of characters in the summary page**
  - Each character has an edit button that will take users to an update form for the relevant character
  - Users can see the current attributes of their character on the update form
  - After editing the character's attribute values using the form, the user can immediately see those changes reflected in the update form and on the summary page 
- [x] **A previously created character can be deleted from the character list**
  - Using the edit form detailed in the previous _characters can be updated_ feature, there is a button that allows users to delete that character
  - After deleting a character, the character should no longer be visible in the summary page
  - [x] **Each character has a direct, unique URL link to an info page about them**
    - Clicking on a character in the summary page navigates to a detail page for that character
    - The detail page contains extra information about the character not included in the summary page
    - Users can navigate to to the edit form from the detail page

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] A character can be given a category upon creation which restricts their attribute value options
  - e.g., a Dungeons and Dragons class or a development team role (project manager, product owner, etc.)
  - User can choose a `category` option to describe their character before any attributes are specified
  - Based on the category value, users are allowed to access only a subset of the possible attributes
- [ ] A section of the summary page, displays summary statistics about a user‚Äôs crew on their crew page
  - e.g., the percent of members with a certain attribute 
- [ ] The summary page displays a custom ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù metric about a user‚Äôs crew which changes the look of the character list
  - e.g., a pirate crew‚Äôs predicted success at commandeering a new galley


The following **additional** features are implemented:

* Character properties have default values on creation and have different input methods

## Database Schema (sql)
create table public."Characters" (
  name text not null,
  class text null default 'N/A'::text,
  lore text null default 'N/A'::text,
  level bigint null default '1'::bigint,
  img text null default '""'::text,
  skills jsonb null default '["N/A"]'::jsonb,
  str bigint null default '0'::bigint,
  dex bigint null default '0'::bigint,
  con bigint null default '0'::bigint,
  int bigint null default '0'::bigint,

## Design Decisions
* Medieval Theme: Chose a medieval aesthetic to match D&D's fantasy setting, using warm colors (golds, browns) and ornate typography.

* Component Architecture: Modular React components for reusability and maintainability.

* Database Design: Normalized schema with appropriate data types and constraints for character attributes.

* User Experience: Prioritized intuitive navigation and immediate visual feedback for all user actions.

## Future Enhancements

* Export Functionality: PDF character sheet generation
* Collaborative Features: Share characters with other users
* Advanced Search: Filter and sort characters by various attributes
